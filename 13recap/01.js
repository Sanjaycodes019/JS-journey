/*

framework
-> complete tool that gives rules and structure
for making website or app
-> controls how our code runs, we must follow the rules
-> bigger in size, many features like state management, routing
-> less flexible, have to work the way it wants
-> angular, vue.js, next.js (React with next)


library
-> collection of readymade functions, makes coding easier
-> can control when and how to use library
-> smaller in size, focuses on a new specific task
-> more flexible, can be use as need
-> react.js, jquery, lodash

Learning Curve
React: Moderate difficulty. Uses JSX (HTML inside JavaScript).
Angular: Hard to learn. Uses TypeScript and complex concepts.
Vue: Easy to learn. Simple syntax and structure.

ðŸ”¹ Structure & Flexibility
React: Flexible; you choose additional tools like routing and state management.
Angular: Strict structure; everything is built-in (routing, state management, forms).
Vue: Balanced; gives flexibility but also has built-in features.

ðŸ”¹ Performance
React & Vue: Uses Virtual DOM for faster updates.
Angular: Uses Real DOM, but optimizations make it fast.

ðŸ”¹ Community & Job Market
React: Huge community, many jobs.
Angular: Used in enterprise-level apps, strong demand.
Vue: Growing, but fewer job opportunities compared to React/Angular.

-> Choose React if you want flexibility, a big community, and many job opportunities.
-> Choose Angular if you are working on a large enterprise project and like TypeScript.
-> Choose Vue if you want an easy-to-learn framework for fast development.
